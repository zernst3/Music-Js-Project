# Music-Js-Project

This is a demonstration of Band.js which is a music creation interface for javascript that uses various oscillators to create sounds. For this project, I decided to demonstrate the functionality of this interface using one of my favorite U2 songs: New Year's Day. It has three main sounds: a drum beat, a bass and melody part.
